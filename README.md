# The Perfect Guess Game

A simple Python game where the user tries to guess a randomly chosen number between 1 and 100. After each guess, the program gives a hint "Higher" or "Lower" until the correct number is found. It then displays the number of possible attempts taken.

# How It Works
- The program uses Python's `random` module to select a number.
- The player keeps guessing until the correct number is guessed.
- Feedback is given after every attempt.
- Total number of guesses is shown at the end.

# How to Run
1. Make sure Python is installed on your system.
2. Run the script using:

```bash
python main.py
